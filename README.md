# First Test Projekt - 30.09.2016
My First Programming test.

This Programm should be able to compare blood types such as AB and compare it with another bloodgroup, A for example, 
and should give out if the Bloodgroups are compatible with each other

This is more a Programming exercise for me to use GitHub with Visual Studio 15 and as Standalone to get used to it.

If anyone is willing to help for example submit changes to my Code or other Help im thankful
